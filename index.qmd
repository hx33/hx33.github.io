Hello everyone, I'm a graduate student in the DSAN program at Georgetown University. I'm from China, and I have been in the US since 2015 when I went to high school at Harding Academy in Searcy, Arkansas. My undergraduate was at University of Washington in Seattle where I studied applied math and graduated in 2022. As you can see, I have been in different places in the US in 8 years time, I were exposed in many unique cultures and got to know a lot of interesting people. I liked the years in Seattle very much because of the good weather and diverse environment, but I think the others places I've been to were nice as well. In my spare time, I like to exercise and do sports like soccer and ping pong, watch movies and TV shows, listening to music and play games. I also enjoy going out with friends for fun.
